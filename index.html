    <section id="AboutMe">
        <p>
            I’m a passionate and self-motivated web developer with a strong interest in building user-friendly and
            visually appealing websites. My focus lies in HTML and CSS, and I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive
            designs. I’m currently expanding my skills in front-end development and always eager to learn new
            technologies. As a fresher, I’m seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects and
            collaborate with like-minded professionals. I believe in continuous learning, writing clean code, and
            staying up to date with modern design trends. I am excited to contribute and grow as a developer in a
            dynamic work environment.
